# ðŸ§ª A/B Testing Experiment Analysis
This project simulates and analyzes an A/B test using Python. It demonstrates the full lifecycle of a typical experiment - from data generation and exploration to statistical testing and insights.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
A/B testing (split testing) is a method used to compare two variants of a product, webpage, or feature to determine which one performs better. In this simulated experiment, we test two groups (A = control, B = variant) and analyze conversion rates.

## ðŸ”§ Tools and Techniques Used
- Python (pandas, numpy, scipy, matplotlib)
- Statistical analysis (z-test for proportions)
- Data simulation
- Group-wise comparisons
- Experiment design logic

## ðŸ“Š Key Steps

1. **Data Simulation** 
    - 1,000 users randomly assigned to Group A or B
    - Group A has 12% conversion, Group B has 15%

2. **Data Exploration**
    - Preview Dataset
    - Calculate conversion rates by group

3. **Visualization**
- Plot conversion differences using bar charts


4. **Hypothesis Testing**
- Run a z-test to determine if the observed difference is statistically significant

## ðŸ“ˆResult

##   Skills Demonstrated
- Experimental design
- Binary outcome analysis
- Hypothesis formulation & testing
- Communication of statistical results
- Data storytelling for business stakeholders

## Next Steps
- Expand to include confidence intervals
- Simulate more metrics (e.g., revenue per user)
- Package into reusable function for repeated tests
